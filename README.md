IMPORTANT NOTE: This project was from my CS1302 course so while all the code regarding making the application function is my intellectual property, the concept was derived from instructiion provided by Dr. Barnes (Bradley J. Barnes) and Dr. Cotterell (Michael E. Cotterell).

The codename turbo-journey is used to mask the identity of the project and the contents it holds.

This project was created to showcase our knowledge of arrays and linked lists and how they operate at a fundamental level. The classes ArrayStringList and LinkedStringList are the two files that showcase this knowledge. They both inherit the methods of BaseStringList. The script "listtester" is used to run the tester file that showcases the accuracy and effectiveness of the methods within the lists.

The most difficult code written in this project was the slice method within LinkedStringList. The issue was how the code moves through a linked-list and the nodes and to edit that list.
